## About

Yowdy!  This light theme is an experiment.  While there's plenty of
gorgeous-looking dark themes, I've had less luck with light themes, so
here's my own take on that.  There's a strong emphasis on shades of
gray, variations in font weight/slant and sometimes a bit of color.
For symmetry's sake a dark version is included.  As a bonus this theme
will work in 256-color terminal emulators as well.  Enjoy!

## Installation

Set up the [MELPA (stable)] repository if you haven't already and
install with `M-x package-install RET punpun-themes RET`.

## Usage

Either load the theme interactively with `M-x load-theme RET
punpun-light RET` or in your init file with:

    (load-theme 'punpun-light t)

Replace `punpun-light` with `punpun-dark` for the dark version.
